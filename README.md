# ThreeJs_SolarSystem
https://fr4zt.github.io/ThreeJs_SolarSystem/

3D solar system made in threeJs, where you can move around and click a planet to view its details. I tried to make planets sizes (not the sun) and orbital speed quite realistic, but there is no planet rotation and realistic orbits shape (they are just circular).

I also wanted to try the trysterio library: https://github.com/dmotz/trystero, so you should see other people connected to the site moving around!
